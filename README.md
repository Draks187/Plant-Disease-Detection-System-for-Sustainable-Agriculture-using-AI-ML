# Project Overview :- 
This project aims to develop an AI/ML-based system to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images to promote sustainable agriculture. Early diagnosis of plant diseases helps farmers take timely actions, reduces crop loss, and enhances agricultural productivity. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately identify disease types and provide actionable insights.

# Features :-
> Image-based detection of multiple plant diseases.
> Uses machine learning models trained on labeled datasets of healthy and diseased leaves.
> Provides disease classification with accuracy metrics.
> User-friendly interface for uploading leaf images and receiving results.
> Helps farmers make informed decisions for crop management.

# Technologies Used :
- Python programming language
- TensorFlow/Keras (or relevant ML frameworks)
- OpenCV for image processing
- NumPy, Pandas for data handling
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation
